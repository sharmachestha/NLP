Got it ‚úÖ Thanks for sharing both the **screenshots** and the **project write-up**. Let me put everything together and explain your project in **short and simple words**:

## üîπ Project Summary ‚Äì Vulcan AI Bot

### 1. **Business Need**

Church & Dwight wanted a **bot powered by LLM (Large Language Model)** to answer business and sales-related questions.
The bot should fetch information either from **SQL databases** (sales/DSR tool) or **documents (PDFs/PPTs via Cognitive Search)**.

---

### 2. **Tech Setup (Prerequisites)**

* **Azure Services**: Cognitive Search, OpenAI, Bot Service, Storage Account, Key Vault.
* **Frontend**: Streamlit (for UI).
* **Backend**: Python (LangChain + Azure OpenAI).
* **Data Sources**: SQL Server (DSR data) + Azure Blob Storage (documents).

---

### 3. **Components of the Bot**

1. **DSR Tool (SQL-based Q\&A)**

   * Connects to SQL DB using ODBC driver.
   * Lets business users query historical sales data.
   * Implemented in `utils.py (SQLDbTool class)`.

2. **Few-Shot Learning**

   * Uses `prompt.py` examples + embeddings.
   * Helps model understand the query better by matching with past examples.

3. **DocSearch Tool (Document-based Q\&A)**

   * Loads PDFs/PPTs from **Azure Blob ‚Üí Cognitive Search Index** (via `load_data_index.ipynb`).
   * Queries the index for relevant text.
   * Implemented in `utils.py (DocSearchTool class)`.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

   * Runs experiments with chunk sizes, neighbors, similarity functions, etc.
   * Script: `HyperParameterTunning.py`.
   * Goal: improve retrieval accuracy and response quality.

5. **Logging & Tracking**

   * Application and LangChain logs stored in **Azure Blob Storage** with timestamps.

---

### 4. **Flow**

* **User asks a question** (via frontend Streamlit UI).
* **Bot decides** ‚Üí If query is sales-related, it goes to **DSR Tool (SQL)**. If it‚Äôs document-related, it goes to **DocSearch Tool (Cognitive Search)**.
* The retrieved data is passed to **Azure OpenAI (GPT)** to generate a natural response.
* Response is shown to the user.

---

### 5. **Next Steps (Improvements Suggested)**

* Clean and preprocess data (stopwords, stemming, lemmatization).
* Explore **LlamaIndex** instead of LangChain for better performance.
* Add **data visualization dashboards**.
* Improve frontend/backend so user doesn‚Äôt need to explicitly type `@dsr` or `@docsearch`.
* Conduct **user testing** for feedback.

## üìù In One Line:

You built a **GenAI-powered bot** that answers business questions using **SQL sales data + documents stored in Azure Cognitive Search**, with backend in **LangChain + Azure OpenAI**, frontend in **Streamlit**, and added **hyperparameter tuning, logging, and few-shot examples** to make responses more accurate.

üëâ Do you also want me to create a **2-minute interview-style explanation** (something you can say directly if asked "Tell me about this project")?


From your project explanation, here‚Äôs the clear answer üëá

OpenAI Library used ‚Üí You are using LangChain with OpenAI (for LLM queries, prompt management, and response generation).

For embeddings ‚Üí You are using OpenAI Embeddings (imported inside your utils.py and prompt.py logic).

These embeddings are used in two main places:

FewShots Implementation ‚Üí to embed the examples from prompt.py and find the closest match with user query.

DocSearch Tool & Hyperparameter Tuning ‚Üí to embed documents (from PDFs/PPTs stored in Azure Blob) and perform similarity search inside Azure Cognitive Search index.

‚ö° So in short:

LLM Calls ‚Üí OpenAI (via LangChain).

Embeddings ‚Üí OpenAIEmbeddings class from OpenAI, integrated with LangChain + Azure Cognitive Search.
